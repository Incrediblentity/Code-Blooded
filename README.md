SmartHarvest: Your Personal Agro-Analyst
Leveraging Agentic AI to forecast crop yields, recommend optimal seeds, and help farmers navigate a changing climate.

Imagine having a personal data scientist who can predict your crop yields with high accuracy.

🌾 About The Project
In an era of unprecedented climate change, traditional farming methods face significant challenges. Unpredictable weather patterns, rising global temperatures, and climatic disturbances threaten food security and the livelihoods of farmers worldwide.

SmartHarvest is a web-based platform that provides farmers, researchers, and agricultural businesses with a personal data scientist. Our agentic AI analyzes vast amounts of climate data to deliver precise, actionable insights for agriculture. The core model is designed to understand and predict the impacts of long-term climate trends, like global warming, on crop production.

Our goal is to empower users to make data-driven decisions that enhance productivity, sustainability, and profitability in the face of climate uncertainty.

✨ Key Features
📈 High-Accuracy Crop Forecasting: Get accurate predictions for crop production and utility based on your specific location.

🌍 Climate-Aware Modeling: Our AI is trained on extensive climate datasets and accounts for global warming trends and other climatic disturbances.

🤖 Agentic AI Interface: Interact with our AI in natural language. Ask complex questions and get detailed, context-aware answers.

🌱 Seed Sourcing: After recommending the most suitable crops, the AI identifies the nearest locations where you can purchase the required seeds.

📊 Data Visualization: Understand complex data through intuitive charts, graphs, and maps.

📍 Location-Based Analysis: Receive insights tailored to the unique climatic and geographical conditions of your area.

🛠️ How It Works
SmartHarvest is built with a modern technology stack to ensure performance, scalability, and a seamless user experience.

Frontend: The user interface is built with a modern JavaScript framework for a responsive and interactive experience.

Backend: A robust Python backend (using Flask/Django) serves the core logic and API endpoints.

Machine Learning Core:

Our pipeline successfully builds an AI system for predicting crop yields based on climate data, accounting for global warming trends using both traditional machine learning (scikit-learn) and deep learning (TensorFlow) approaches.

The predictive engine is trained on a diverse range of datasets, including historical weather data, climate projection models, and agricultural yield statistics.

The model utilizes time-series analysis and regression techniques to make accurate forecasts, achieving an R² score of 0.7841. This indicates that our model explains approximately 78% of the variance in crop yields—a strong result for this type of prediction task.

APIs:

Google Maps API: Used for geographic data processing and to locate the nearest seed suppliers.

Climate Data APIs: We integrate with leading climate data providers to ensure our models are always up-to-date.

Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

Node.js and npm

Git

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git)
cd your-repo


Backend Setup:

cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt


Frontend Setup:

cd ../frontend
npm install


Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the backend directory and add your API keys:

GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
CLIMATE_DATA_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'


Run the Application:

Start the backend server (from the backend directory):

python app.py


Start the frontend development server (from the frontend directory):

npm start


Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to see the application.

🖼️ Usage and Demo
Upon visiting the site, you can interact with the AI assistant:

Enter your location or allow the browser to detect it.

Ask a question in the chat interface, for example:

"What is the predicted yield for corn in my area for the next season?"

"Which crops are most resilient to the expected heatwaves this summer?"

"Where can I buy high-quality tomato seeds near me?"

The AI will process your request and provide a detailed response, including data visualizations and a map of seed suppliers.

🗺️ Roadmap
We have an exciting future planned for SmartHarvest. Here are some of the features we're working on:

 Integrate real-time satellite imagery for soil health analysis.

 Expand the database to include a wider variety of crops and global regions.

 Develop a mobile application for on-the-go access.

 Introduce models for predicting pest and disease outbreaks.

 Offer subscription tiers with more advanced analytics for commercial farms.
